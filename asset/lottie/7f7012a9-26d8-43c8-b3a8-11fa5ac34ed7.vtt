Hello students, it is given in the problem that

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.160 A:middle L:90%
x raised to j omega, which is equal to

3
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:14.800 A:middle L:90%
1 minus a square divided by 1 minus a raised

4
00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.179 A:middle L:90%
to minus j omega into 1 minus a e raised

5
00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:24.219 A:middle L:90%
to j omega for part a we want to find

6
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.480 A:middle L:90%
the Sequence of x of n by partial fraction we

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.519 A:middle L:90%
can write x, raise to j omega, as

8
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.740 A:middle L:90%
that is x, raise to j omega, which

9
00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:38.060 A:middle L:90%
is equal to 1 by 1 minus. A e

10
00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.320 A:middle L:90%
raised to j omega plus 1 by 1 minus a

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.359 A:middle L:90%
e raised to minus j omega taking in verse,

12
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.539 A:middle L:90%
for you transform that is x n equal to a

13
00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.659 A:middle L:90%
raised to nu of n minus 1 by a word

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.439 A:middle L:90%
raised to n of n minus 1. That is

15
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.179 A:middle L:90%
x of n can be written as x of n

16
00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.700 A:middle L:90%
, which is equal to a raised to n.

17
00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:08.420 A:middle L:90%
U of n minus a raised 2 minus n?

18
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.579 A:middle L:90%
U of n minus 1 mark- and this is

19
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.599 A:middle L:90%
the sequence of x of n for part b.

20
00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.099 A:middle L:90%
We want to calculate the integral minus pi 2 pi

21
00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.500 A:middle L:90%
x, raise to j omega cos omega d omega

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.379 A:middle L:90%
divided by 2 pi that is x, o n

23
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.079 A:middle L:90%
, which is equal to 1 by 2 pi,

24
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.939 A:middle L:90%
integral minus pi, 2 pi x e raise to

25
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.379 A:middle L:90%
j omega e raised To j, omega n plus

26
00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.540 A:middle L:90%
j omega in omega, we have, from the

27
00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.920 A:middle L:90%
sequence a we can write x of 1, which

28
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.219 A:middle L:90%
is equal to a minus 1 by a and x

29
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:06.599 A:middle L:90%
of 1 equal to 0. By equation a now

30
00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.400 A:middle L:90%
, we can write x of 1, which is

31
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.340 A:middle L:90%
equal to 1 by 2 pi, integral minus pi

32
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.039 A:middle L:90%
, 2 pi x e raise to j omega into

33
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.500 A:middle L:90%
e, raise to j, omega d, omega

34
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.719 A:middle L:90%
markets, 1 and x of minus 1 equal to

35
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.620 A:middle L:90%
integral minus pi. 2 pi 1 by 2 pi

36
00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.860 A:middle L:90%
e raise to j omega into e, raise to

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.080 A:middle L:90%
minus j omega d omega market as to from 2

38
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.800 A:middle L:90%
and 1. Add these equations together that is x

39
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.860 A:middle L:90%
of 1 plus x of minus 1, which is

40
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.439 A:middle L:90%
equal to 1 by 2 pi. Integral minus pi

41
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.479 A:middle L:90%
2 pi x e raise to j omega into e

42
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.840 A:middle L:90%
, raise to j omega plus e, raise to

43
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.939 A:middle L:90%
minus j omega d omega. This can be written

44
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.020 A:middle L:90%
as x of 1 plus x of minus 1,

45
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.560 A:middle L:90%
which is equal to 1 by 2 pi integral minus

46
00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:21.719 A:middle L:90%
pi 2 pi x e, raised to j omega

47
00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.280 A:middle L:90%
2 cos omega t omega, that is equal to

48
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.120 A:middle L:90%
1 by 2 pi, integral minus pi, 2

49
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.939 A:middle L:90%
Pi x e, raise to j omega cos omega

50
00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.400 A:middle L:90%
d omega that is x of 1 plus x of

51
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.219 A:middle L:90%
minus 1, divided by 2, that is equal

52
00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.879 A:middle L:90%
to a minus 1 by a divided by 2.

53
00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.439 A:middle L:90%
On calculation, we get the value of integral,

54
00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.900 A:middle L:90%
as which is equal to a square minus 1 divided

55
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.259 A:middle L:90%
by 2. An i hope you find the video

56
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.599 A:middle L:90%
useful. Thank you.
